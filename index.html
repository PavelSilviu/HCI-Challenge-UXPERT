      </b>
    </p>
    <p>Use case: “having a presentation in a messy and noisy room”;</p>
    <p>The interaction flow is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sign in to zoom</li>
      <li>Enter/Join the room</li>
      <li>Select a background</li>
      <li>Mute microphone when not speaking</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Desktop application</b></p>
    <p><b>1. Sign in to zoom</b></p>
    <p>
      At first zoom has a login page which is intuitive. Input boxes have
      placeholders specifying what we must write there. The button “Sign In” is
      deactivated initially suggesting that we have to complete the input and
      then press “Sign in”.
    </p>
    <img src="z1.png" />
    <p>
      Here, affordances are represented by logos of apps we cand sign in with
      and they are accompanied by their names below them.
    </p>
    <img src="z2.png" />
    <p><b>2. Enter the room </b></p>
    <img src="3.png" />
    <p>Input boxes have specific placeholders.</p>
    <p>
      Check boxes below with “don’t connect to audio” and “turn off my video”
      are unticked by default allowing us to select a background first and
      activate our microphone only when we talk
    </p>
    <p><b>3. Change background </b></p>
    <p>
      To change the background, we have to click on the arrow near the camera
      icon. This “arrow” suggests that a hamburger menu will open.
    </p>
    <img src="4.png" />
    <p><b>4. Mute microphone when not speaking</b></p>
    <p>
      For the microphone we have a specific image with a microphone and is very
      suggestive that we have to click on it in order to mute because below the
      icon is written “Mute”.
    </p>
    <img src="z5.png" />
    <p><b>Web application</b></p>
    <p>The steps are the same as for the desktop application.</p>
    <p>Proposing better approaches:</p>
    <p>
      If there is noise in your room when you are talking the noise will be
      heard by the other participants. I would implement a system to cancel the
      unnecessary noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        >Compare the visual metaphors and idioms and suggest similar ones for a
        textonly interaction (see CLI – Command Line Interface).
      </b>
    </p>
    <p><b>Idioms</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          First idioms that we encounter are check boxes from logi in section.
          Those are good idioms because the user already used check boxes on
          other apps and will remember what check boxes represent.
        </p>

        <img src="3.png" />

        <p>
          For a text only interactions I would suggest that the app asks the
          user if he want to check the settings and the user will respond with
          “Y” for yes and “N” for no.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Next we have the small arrow that will open a menu. The user will
          learn what options will be revealed by the arrow.
        </p>
        <img src="4.png" />
        <p>
          For a text only interactions I would create a specific command that
          shows on the screen the menu and the user will navigate through menu
          using arrows up and down, and will select the desired command pressing
          enter.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In option section we ecounter the “Gallery View” idiom.</p>
        <img src="6.png" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In meeting settings area we have plenty of radio boxes that are
          idioms.
        </p>
        <img src="8.png" />
        <p>
          For text only interactions I would implement the same concept from the
          first idiom.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Metaphors</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We encounter metaphors that suggest if microphone and camera are on or
          off.
        </p>
        <img src="7.png" />
        <p>
          A text only interaction app could replace this with a text saying:
          “camera: ff, microphone: off”.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Another metaphor is used for inviting user in meeting.</p>
        <img src="9.png" />
      </li>

    <p>
      <b>Discuss the cognitive overload in special conditions/contexts. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      According tu uxplanet.org: “In terms of UX design, cognitive load is the
      strain a user experiences when he/she has to think too much just to get
      something done. Anything that requires users to stop and figure out what
      to do next is cognitive load.”
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          A special context where cognitive overload appears may be when an
          elder person uses this app. If that person wants to share a white
          board with the other participants he/she should go to “File” / ”Your
          Computer” / ”White Board”. There are three steps to do and this could
          pe too much for an elder who doesn’t have enough experience.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Another special context could be when a person who doesn’t know
          english very well is the host of a presentation and wants to end it.
          That person will have to chose between “End meeting for all” and
          “Leave meeting”.

        platforms – for instance, Web + mobile native, desktop native + mobile
        native. Each improvement will be listed
      </b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The first problem is available for all platforms: web, desktop,
          mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Problem:</b> The main audience don’t pay to upgrade the app to
          premium version so they encounter the following problem with time
          limit of the meeting.
        </p>
        <img src="11.png" />
        <p>
          <b>Solution:</b>Increase the time limit to at least 2 hours because
          Zoom app is very used in schools and universities where a course lasts
          more than the current time limit.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>How the empiric laws (Fitts’, Hick’s, Steering) might be reconsidered/adapted in the context of multi-device interaction?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the context of multi-device interaction in Zoom, Fitts' law may need to be adapted keeping account of the different types of pointing devices 
      (trackpads, graphics tablets, touchscreens, etc.) with varying levels of precision and control. Additionally, the distance between the devices and 
      the targets may vary depending on the layout of the user's workspace. Therefore, a revised version of 
      Fitts' law for multi-device interaction in Zoom might need to take into account the variability of pointing devices and the physical layout of the 
      user's workspace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hick's law states that the time required to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of choices presented. In the context of multi-device 
      interaction in Zoom, Hick's law may need to be reconsidered to account for the fact that users may be switching between different devices and modes of 
      interaction (using a mouse on a laptop, then switching to a touchscreen on a tablet). This can lead to increased cognitive load and decision-making time,
       particularly if the user needs to adjust to different options or gestures. A revised version of Hick's law for multi-device interaction in Zoom might need 
       to account for the additional cognitive load associated with switching between devices and interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steering law may need to be adapted in Zoom to account for the fact that users may be using different types of devices with different interfaces for controlling
       the cursor (mouse, touchpad, touhscreen, game controller, etc.). Additionally, the angle of movement may vary depending on the layout of the user's workspace and
        the position of the devices. A revised version of Steering law for multi-device interaction in Zoom might need to take into account the variability of devices 
        and the physical layout of the user's workspace.

      <b>List three new features that can be added to improve the experience and sketch those new features on paper and/or digitally. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mood Indicators: This feature would allow users to indicate their mood or emotional state during a meeting, and this thing would be avalaible in Zoom Participants menu, 
      along the e-mail, name and the meeting ID. Users could select an emoji or icon that reflects their current mood, such as happy, sad or neutral. The mood indicators could 
      provide valuable feedback to the host or presenter about how the audience is feeling. This feature would help to promote empathy and understanding among people and could 
      lead to more productive and engaging meetings.
    </p>
    <img

    <p>
      Virtual World: This feature would allow users to choose special avatars and communicate to each other, similarly with a game like Club Penguin. 
      They will enter in special rooms, with different backrounds and special avalaible activities.
    </p>
    <img
    src="virtual.jpg" width="60%"
    />
    <p>
      AI-powered Meeting Assistant: This feature would use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to do specifical actions in
       Zoom application, asked by the user. This would be particularly useful for users who struggle to keep up with the fast pace of meetings and want to 
       save time on administrative tasks.

      something done. Anything that requires users to stop and figure out what

    </p>
    <p>
      1) Cognitive overload can occur during a Google Meet in special
      conditions/contexts where the participant has multiple distractions that
      can draw their attention away from the meeting. For example, having many
      tabs open and receiving numerous notifications can cause cognitive
      overload, leading to a reduced attention span and decreased productivity
      during the meeting. Without a dedicated desktop app for Google Meet, it
      can be challenging to reduce cognitive overload in such situations. One
      strategy is to close all other apps and tabs except for those needed for
      Google Meet. However, this may be challenging for some individuals who
      struggle with organization

      style="width: 80vw"
    />
    <p>
      2) Cognitive overload can occur in various special conditions, including
      when a person is sharing their screen during a Google Meet call while at
      home with family members who may be making noise or causing distractions.
      In such situations, the person may struggle to concentrate on the meeting
      and may experience a decrease in their overall productivity. Furthermore,
      when the person wants to stop sharing their screen, it can be challenging
      for them to find the appropriate controls, especially if they have
      accidentally shared their entire screen instead of a specific window. This
      can lead to additional cognitive overload and frustration, as the person
      is then presented with multiple buttons and options to close the share
      screen feature.

      </b>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Fitts' law, which predicts the time it takes for a user to complete a pointing task based on the distance to the target and the size of the target, might need to consider the size and placement of the user interface elements across different devices. For instance, the interface elements like buttons and icons on a tablet or mobile device may be smaller than those on a desktop, which could make it more difficult for users to accurately and efficiently interact with them. Therefore, designers could adapt the size and placement of the user interface elements to better accommodate the different device sizes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hick's law, which predicts the time it takes for a user to make a decision based on the number of options available, might need to consider the cognitive load imposed by the use of multiple devices on the user's performance. For example, if a user needs to switch between multiple devices during a Google Meet session, the increased cognitive load of remembering the context and tasks associated with each device could slow down their decision-making process. Therefore, designers could simplify the user interface to minimize the number of options presented to the user and make the transition between devices smoother.
        </li>
        <li>
            Steering law, which predicts the time it takes for a user to move a cursor to a target, might need to consider the physical challenges of moving between devices during a Google Meet session. For instance, users may need to move their attention and mouse cursor from one device to another, which could increase the time it takes to complete a task. Therefore, designers could optimize the user interface across different devices to minimize the need for users to switch between them during the Google Meet session. This could be done by consolidating all essential controls and features within a single device or interface, thereby reducing the need for users to switch between devices.
